# M2S2 - Multi Modal Sensor Suite 

## Description 

![m2s2_system](docs/resources/Fig2_m2s2.jpg)

This repo contains [ROS2](https://docs.ros.org/en/foxy/index.html) drivers for various sensors to collect raw, synchronized, high-speed RGB video, stereoscopic depth video, mmWave radar, thermal, event, LiDAR and audio measurements. 

This repo also contains all mechanical designs used, as well as extrinsic calibration data and procedures used in the design of this system. 

In addition, we present the first M2S2 dataset containing wild cheetah behaviour.

## Prerequisites
- [Ubuntu 20.04 LTS](https://releases.ubuntu.com/focal/) 
- [ROS2 foxy](https://docs.ros.org/en/foxy/Installation.html)
  
- For dependencies of specific drivers, please refer to the corresponding README file. 

## Setup

### ROS2 Foxy
For ROS2 installation, please refer to the official ROS2 installation guide: [ROS2-foxy installation guide](https://docs.ros.org/en/foxy/Installation.html)

### RMW-ecal
Using [eCAL RWM](https://github.com/eclipse-ecal/rmw_ecal) as an alternative to ROS2 DDS middleware implementations showed significant perfomance improvements.

Install [eCAL](https://eclipse-ecal.github.io/ecal/getting_started/setup.html)
```bash
$ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ecal/ecal-latest
$ sudo apt-get update 
$ sudo apt-get install ecal
```

Clone the latest release of the [ecal-rmw](https://github.com/eclipse-ecal/rmw_ecal) repository into your ROS2 workspace and build it. 

```bash
$ cd ~/ros2_ws
$ git clone https://github.com/eclipse-ecal/rmw_ecal.git
$ cd ~/ros2_ws/rmw_ecal
$ colcon build --packages-skip rmw_ecal_proto_cpp
$ vim ~/.bashrc   # add "source ~/ros2_ws/rmw_ecal/install/setup.bash"
$ source ~/.bashrc
```

Add the following line into your `.bashrc` to run all nodes using eCAL middleware
```bash
export RMW_IMPLEMENTATION=rmw_ecal_dynamic_cpp
```

## Usage
The launch files in this repo can be used to launch the ros2 nodes of all the sensors used in M2S2 simultaneously and visualise (and hear) the output streams. 

clone this repo to your ros2 workspace source directory:

```bash
$ cd ~/ros2_ws
$ git clone 
$ cd ~/ros2_ws/M2S2
$ colcon build --packages-select m2s2_bringup

$ ros2 launch m2s2_bringup m2s2.launch.py

# To view the stream
$ ros2 launch m2s2_bringup m2s2_display.launch.py 
```

<b>Note:</b> For usage instructions of specific drivers, please refer to the corresponding README file. 

## Deserialise Data 
Using the eCAL RMW, one can record data using their powerful [recording](https://eclipse-ecal.github.io/ecal/getting_started/recorder.html) tool. All data is stored as an ecal_measurement in .hdf5 files. 

Our [m2s2_ecal_deserializers](m2s2_ecal_deserializers) provides deserializers to convert raw M2S2 measurements into readable data.  

## Calibration
The Intel Realsense RGB camera was used as the reference (global) frame for all extrinsic calibration between M2S2 sensors.

### Thermal Camera 
To perform extrinsic calibration between the Intel RealSense and FLIR Boson 640, we propose a calibration target made of a laser-cut checkerboard pattern overlayed onto an aluminum covered surface. The checkerboard is then heated using two halogen lamps. This creates distinct features in the calibration target and the board is visible in both the RGB and IR camera. 

Given the different resolutions of the thermal images (640 x 512) and the reference images from the Intel RealSense (1080 x 720), we used the MATLAB community [Calibration-Under Different-Resolution toolbox](https://github.com/balcilar/Calibration-Under_Different-Resolution). This toolboox modifies Matlabâ€™s calibration app to accept cameras of different resolutions.

### LiDAR
Matlab's [Lidar Camera Calibrator](https://www.mathworks.com/help/lidar/ref/lidarcameracalibrator-app.html) app was used to perform geometric calibration between the Livox Avia and the Intel RealSense. 

### Event Camera
We used the open-source toolbox [E2Calib](https://github.com/uzh-rpg/e2calib) to perform event-camera calibration. The toolbox reconstructs visible images from event data using [E2VID](https://github.com/uzh-rpg/rpg_e2vid). The reconstructed images were then used in Matlab's [Stereo Camera calibrator app](https://www.mathworks.com/help/vision/ref/stereocameracalibrator-app.html) to perform extrinsic calibration between the event camera and the reference Intel RealSense.

### mmWave Radar

### Ximea High-speed Camera
Matlab's [Stereo Camera calibrator app](https://www.mathworks.com/help/vision/ref/stereocameracalibrator-app.html) was used to perform extrinsic calibration between the Ximea and Intel RealSense.
